# Changelog

All notable changes to Cycle for Zcode are recorded here. Installed plugin
content is immutable: a published version is never reused for different bytes.

## [1.0.1] - Unreleased

Status: **release candidate blocked until every Windows/Linux certification
gate passes against the same immutable plugin archive**.

### Planned

- Repair Linux installation and define the supported glibc baseline.
- Conform to the official ZCode marketplace contract and disclosures.
- Add reproducible release-candidate CI, SBOM, notices, checksums and
  provenance.
- Certify install, quick/full workflows, repair, resume, browser evidence,
  upgrade, uninstall and rollback on the exact release bytes.

### Changed during candidate hardening

- PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks consume ZCode's newline-delimited protocol
  without waiting for stdin closure.
- A Cycle role dispatch now requires one unique active registration, so a raw
  direct role launch cannot bypass the role/hook contract.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-21 - WITHDRAWN

Do not install this version.

- Installable content changed after the first publication without a version
  bump, including removal of a development-machine binary path.
- A clean Linux checkout stored the bundled daemon without its executable bit,
  so the MCP bridge could not start it.
- The public CI run was not green and its Windows smoke command failed under a
  non-blocking `continue-on-error` step.

The `v1.0.0` tag remains available only as audit history. It must not be moved,
rewritten or reused.
